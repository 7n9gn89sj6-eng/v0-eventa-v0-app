# v0 Project Safety Policy (Eventa)

- Do NOT run or modify any files in `scripts/` unless explicitly asked.
- Do NOT generate or run `.sql` / `.ts` database migration/seed files unless explicitly asked.
- Do NOT alter environment variables except when I explicitly request it.
- Do NOT remove imports, files, or routes without providing a clear diff and asking for confirmation.
- Keep `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_ENABLED=false` unless I say to enable auth.
- Never add build-time DB actions (no seeding/migrations in `postbuild`).
- If an action may be destructive or irreversible, ask me first.
