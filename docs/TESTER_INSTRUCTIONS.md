# Welcome to Eventa Beta Testing! 🎉

Thank you for helping us test Eventa! This guide will help you understand what Eventa is, how to use it, and what we'd love your feedback on.

---

## What is Eventa?

**Eventa is a community events discovery platform** that helps people find and share local events using natural, everyday language.

### Our Philosophy

Eventa is built with these core values:

- **📝 Plain Language**: Talk to Eventa like you'd talk to a friend. No keywords, no filters, just natural questions.
- **🌍 First Language Support**: Search in your own language (English, Italian, Greek, Spanish, French). We understand you.
- **🤝 Community-First**: Real events from real people, prioritized over web search results.
- **📱 Mobile-First**: Built for phones first, tablets second, desktop last.
- **🎯 Forgiving, Not Perfect**: Results should feel reasonable, not rigid. We prioritize understanding over perfection.

## How to Use Eventa

### 1. **Search for Events** (No Sign-In Required)

Just type or say what you're looking for in plain language:

**Examples:**
- "jazz concerts in Paris this weekend"
- "food markets in Rome in April"
- "I'm going to Berlin for a week and like music and food"
- "things happening near me tonight"
- "community events in Athens"

**What Eventa does:**
- Understands your question in natural language
- Extracts location, date, and interests automatically
- Shows you relevant events, with community events first

**Try it:**
- Search in your preferred language
- Use trip-style queries (e.g., "I'm going to...")
- Test location detection (click the map pin icon)
- Mix and match: location + category + date

---

### 2. **Browse Events**

- Click "Browse" in the header to see all events
- Use filters (date, category, city) to narrow results
- Click any event to see full details
- Export events to your calendar (.ics file)

---

### 3. **Create an Event** (Sign-In Required)

If you'd like to post an event:

1. Click "Post Event" on the homepage
2. Sign in with your email (magic link, no password needed)
3. Fill out the event form:
   - Title and description
   - Date and time
   - Location (address or venue name)
   - Category
   - Price (free or paid)
4. Submit your event
5. Check your email for an edit link (you can edit without logging in again!)

**Note**: Events go through AI moderation for safety. Most are approved automatically, but some may need human review.

## Thank You! 🙏

Your feedback is invaluable in making Eventa better. We're building this for you, and your real-world testing helps us understand what works and what doesn't.

**Remember**: Eventa is about feeling understood, not perfect. If something feels "close enough" or "reasonable," that's okay! We want to know when it feels wrong, not when it's imperfect.

Happy testing! 🎉
